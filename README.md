# Measures, categories and clusters

In the csv data and the notebooks the following terminology is used for the different metrics, groups of metrics and other measures:

- **Metric** : One of the rules of one of the tools. The number is the number of times a tool found lines of code that violated this specific rule.
- **Category** : The category in which the tool itself places a metric. The number is the number of times a tool found lines of code that violated one of the rules in this category.
- **Cluster** : The category for a metric *as assigned by this study*. The number is the number of times a tool found lines of code that violated one of the rules in this category.
- **Measure** : One of the metrics, categories, clusters or other aspect such as total number of errors found that is calculated for an assignment.
